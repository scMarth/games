The EXP Hall DLC - killing digimon here doesn't give you EXP directly, it gives you items which can then be used to increase EXP for the digimon you use it on

increasing talent: I am not sure if it's a bug, but if I just keep digivolving and de-digivolving to and from the same 2 digimon e.g. agu > grey > agu > grey > agu > grey etc. it slowly but surely increases the talent....

so maybe it's a good idea to just get everyone to 100 now rather than wait and have to do it later? on the other hand, you can just use load enhancements too

guide to max stats easily (load enhancements): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcNRiMK0Ans
    convert @ 100% then use for load enhancement
there is a quicker way to do it with the digifarm, but the stat increases will go away after digivolving: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjYys9JolS0

Digi egg of miracles:

    requires 3x Digi-Jewel and 1 Immortal Egg
    randomly got it from the treasure drop Meruki mon's place at the top of the stairs where Ginryumon is

Personality notes:
    - seems that personality when you're converting is RNG, but more or less any digimon can digivolve into any other digimon, so it's easy to farm scanned digimon and find the right personality
