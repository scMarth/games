The EXP Hall DLC - killing digimon here doesn't give you EXP directly, it gives you items which can then be used to increase EXP for the digimon you use it on

stat farm: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hojQKKN2v3A
    apparently 200% scans are the best for load enhancing and boosting stats

GranKuwagamon EXP farming strat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peEqTXhOHTo
    for this reason alone, it is good to have a Zealous GranKuwaga with 100 talent / bond, or at least prepare for one when you unlock mega digivolutions, and feeding one with load enhancements seems to help the exveemons too

afk EXP farming strat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY4e_xPeDJY

increasing talent: I am not sure if it's a bug, but if I just keep digivolving and de-digivolving to and from the same 2 digimon e.g. agu > grey > agu > grey > agu > grey etc. it slowly but surely increases the talent....

so maybe it's a good idea to just get everyone to 100 now rather than wait and have to do it later? on the other hand, you can just use load enhancements too

digi-ride digimon: https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/556611

guide to max stats easily (load enhancements): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcNRiMK0Ans
    convert @ 100% then use for load enhancement
there is a quicker way to do it with the digifarm, but the stat increases will go away after digivolving: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjYys9JolS0

Digi egg of miracles:
https://game8.co/games/Digimon-Story-Time-Stranger/archives/556015
    requires 3x Digi-Jewel and 1 Immortal Egg
    randomly got it from the treasure drop Meruki mon's place at the top of the stairs where Ginryumon is

Personality notes:
    - chart: https://nightlygamingbinge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Digimon-Personality-Type-1024x538.webp
    - seems that personality when you're converting is RNG, but more or less any digimon can digivolve into any other digimon, so it's easy to farm scanned digimon and find the right personality

        Friendly An amiable heart boosts DEF and ATK growth.

personality skills: https://www.grindosaur.com/en/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/personality-skills
    brave Vitality Theft	Recovers HP equal to 10% of physical attack skill damage dealt.
    Overprotective Great Embrace	Overheals to up to 200% of target's Max HP when using recovery skills.
    Sly Combo Magic	Chance of activating skill again when using a magic attack skill. (The lower the HP, the greater the chance.)

    bug: seems like there is a bug for combo magic + great embrace (overprotective) personality skills - can heal above 100% health, which for some reason puts you at a health range where combo magic always triggers
        source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYTKfvKgY68

            also : apparently SPD attachment will prioritize that digimon compared to another who has the same SPD but has no attachments

            great embrace also is good with stout strength, which boosts atk based on user's HP



exp farming:

    grab the outer dungeon in the gear forest to get the tyrant kabuterimon from it since its lvl60 and his special skill is insane

    with it as is you can then leave south east of the gear forest

    there are 2 lilamon, 1 veggy, 1 kiwi, 1 etemon and 1-2 birdramon

    with it as is you can oneshot the veggy, kiwi and lilamons with the digi attack alone which is insane exp and pretty good food and the etemon can be oneshot with the digiattack if you train attack a bit or you just oneshot it with an aoe in an actual fight.

    but ignoring the birdramons since those are tough to oneshot with it thats ~3,5k exp and 30 veggy+kiwi %, 20% etemon and 40% lilamon (so 60% champ and 60% ultimate) which takes about 25sec per rotation

    im in post game almost about to start my mega+ run and i havent found a better farming spot yet

early DNA farming:
    https://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/1o1qpuj/time_stranger_scan_farms/
        If you’re looking to farm up an army of fodder, I’d say it’s better to get a Pat Amon and digivolve it into Godramon, dedigivolve it down to Shoukkomon and dedigivolve that into Angemon and Ankylomon. Then take the angemon up the magnaangemon route up to Godramon and repeat the process. Lets you farm out an army of Ankylomon as a result.
